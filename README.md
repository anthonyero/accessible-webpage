# Horiseon Web Accessibility Refactoring Exercise

## Description

Ensuring webpages incorporate web accessibility standards into their design allows a wider base to interact with the page utilizing assistive technologies. This repository is a refactoring exercise for an existing "Horiseon" webpage with the intention of improving and ensuring the webpage is compatible with assistive technologies.

Changes made include:

- Adding a concise, descriptive title
- Implementing semantic HTML elements
- Ensuring that all HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
- Ensuring that all heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Providing alt attributes for icon and image elements 
- Consolidating CSS selectors and properties
- Repairing anchor links in the index.html file
- Providing thorough comments in the HTML and CSS files
